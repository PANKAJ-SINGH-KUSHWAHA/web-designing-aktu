            "Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary."<br><br>

            To increase the worldly wisdom and awareness, the reading rooms have an important role to play in the life and routine of the students. We follow the same rule here in PSIT as well.<br><br>

            We have a fully air-conditioned Central Library with proper seating capacity and flexible timings so that the students can utilize their time. Computer systems in the library help students to explore the contents available on the internet. It is one of the best information centers where the students can utilize their time and energy by gaining thorough knowledge about the subjects of their course and interests. In PSIT, we provide students with books of all genres, which help them to enhance their skills in subjects apart from the academic curriculum. The students who are aiming to appear for other competitive examinations can also take help from the books available in the Library.
